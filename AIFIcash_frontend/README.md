# AIFIcash

The problem AIFIcash solves

Real-time streaming can be loosely translated as a constant flow of assets from one wallet to another every second. It makes transactions much faster and also enables a trust-less environment.

This could change the obsolete ways used nowadays which involve setting transactions, setting agreements, and hence open up many possibilities in recurring transactions, micro-consultation services, and other engagements where time is money.

#### Some use cases-
1) Payrolls - AIFIcash can be used by companies to pay their employees in crypto. Employees can withdraw the amount by seconds. The crypto solution can ensure trustless payments.
2) Freelance - In freelancing, it can ensure that freelancer is payed for the time he worked. The client can also cancel the stream midway if he finds the work is not good.
3) The protocol can be used for OTT (Over the top) platforms like Netflix, spotify, and other subscription based services. 
4) Micro consultation services can also benifit by the AIFIcash protocol, to ensure trustless payments.

Real-time finance makes it 10x easier for people to take ultra short-term jobs on the Internet.
